<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Master student, Department of Computer Science and Technology, [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). My supervisor is [Prof. Lijun Wu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lijun-Wu-4).  I received my Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering at [Chengdu University of Information Technology (CUIT)](https://english.cuit.edu.cn/).

My research focuses on reinforcement learning, multimodal machine learning, game theory, and LLM-based agents, which are the tangible expressions of my passion for realizing artificial general intelligence. My research vision is to integrate reinforcement learning, multimodal machine learning, and game theory, aiming to develop artificial intelligence agents that perceive their environment, learn from multimodal data, improve from human feedback or preferences, coordinate actions for common goals, and adapt dynamically.
